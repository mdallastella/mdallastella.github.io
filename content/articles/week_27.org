This is a summary of week 27:

** Taking notes
I'm not really a neat person, so I need some kind of system to keep my notes
organized. I tried different systems in the past, from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten][Zettelkasten]] to [[https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/][BASB]], but
in the end, no complex system worked for me.

This week, I set up a minimal workflow to help me collect and digest the
information I need.

As an old-time Emacs user, I'm using Org-mode, [[https://github.com/orgzly-revived/orgzly-android-revived][Orgzly Revived]], and [[https://wallabag.org/][Wallabag]] to
keep track of the stuff I came across online. I'm going to dig into this
workflow in a separate blog post.

** Python and data science
I've used Python when I was a freelancer (mostly Django projects), but
when I had the chance to start my business, I chose [[https://clojure.org/][Clojure]] as the main language
(another possible blog post about why).

Unfortunately, some very useful Python libraries are yet to be fully matched by
a Clojure counterpart, especially in the data science field. Years ago, I took a
"Machine Learning" course by Andrew Ng on Coursera, and the whole course was
based on [[https://octave.org/][Octave]]. Early this year I started the same course, and now it's fully
on Python and Jupyter notebooks.

So I'm working to brush up on my Python knowledge. My goal is to create some
ML/AI proofs of concept with it, and then refine or integrate them with Clojure.

** Projects
Last year, I took over a dye formulation and quality control software for the
textile industry from another developer. This involves quite some math and
patience, since the source code is Python and Vue.js. Anyway it's fun to play
with spectrophotometers.

In my "free time", I'm working on a project (Clojure, this time) for extracting
structured data from digital documents (PDF/docx/images), such as technical sheets
or certificates of analysis.

** Personal health
There were some not-so-good moments in the past week: I had a couple of anxiety
hiccups: I dealt with them quite well, but still a PITA. My mood swings from
"I can do it" to "I'm a fraud". I'm lucky to have my partner's support,
encouraging me to go out and try not to think too much about work. Also, my two
dogs cheer me up when I am in a bad mood.
