** Personal
In the last weeks there were some ups and downs, I had to deal with some
anxiety, but it has been much better than [[/posts/week_39/][week 39]]. The change of season and the
switch from DST to Standard Time always takes a toll on my mental health.

That said, I'm not a hermit. I'm still enjoying going out with my girlfriend and
friends. My agoraphobia kicks in only when I'm alone.

In the past weeks, in random order:

*** Conegliano & The Winged Lion
We visited some friends in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conegliano][Conegliano]] (one of the birthplaces of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecco][Prosecco]] wine),
we visited the "Winged Lion" made by Marco Martalar. Martalar's sculptures are
made with the wood of the fallen trees caused by the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Adrian#Art][Storm Vaia]] in [[https://www.guidedolomiti.com/en/miscellaneous/storm-vaia/][2018]]. There
are a few of these sculptures. You can see them [[https://www.artsharing.org/artisti/marco-martalar][here]].

After a short hike, we had lunch together at [[https://www.andreetta.it/][Andreetta]] restaurant: fine wines
and delicious food.

Probably the next sculpture we are going to visit will be the "Winged Dragon" in
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarone][Lavarone]].

*** Halloween
The last time I did something fun on Halloween night was in 2010. That night,
one of the main rivers in Vicenza (my hometown), flooded our district, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgo_San_Pietro_(Vicenza)][Borgo San
Pietro]]. We went to a treasure hunt that night, dressed up as monsters. The next
day we woke up with 30cm of brown water inside the house. By the end of that
morning the water rose to about 1m, so we fled and got hospitality from family
members and friends. We moved back in our home a year after.

So no, I don't really like Halloween, and for years after I couldn't enjoy the
sound of the rain.

This year we celebrated Halloween after 15 years, I dressed as a vampire (quite
easy), and my gf as a voodoo queen. We met with some friends at a local club and
"enjoyed" a cover band of Nightwish and Epica (not really my music genre). I was
tense at the beginning, but after a couple of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americano_(cocktail)][Americano]] I started to enjoy the
evening.

** Code
*** LLM
I discovered [[https://openrouter.ai/][OpenRouter]] and cancelled my OpenAI plan. OpenRouter allows to get
access to multiple LLM models thanks to a unified API and it also automatically
routes your prompts to the "best" model based on cost, latency and availability.
(I'm not related with OpenRouter in any way, I just think it's a wonderful
service).

Thanks to OpenRouter I managed to:
- Deploy an instance of [[https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui][OpenWebUI]], to have a "personal" Chat and RAG experience,
  choosing between 500+ models.
- Implement a couple of useful [[https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n][n8n]] workflows, such as transforming documents,
  photos, or vocal memos directly to org-mode, ready to be copied and pasted
  through a Telegram bot.
- Start to use Claude Code cli tool. Thanks to [[https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router][Claude Code Router]] (ccr), I can
  use OpenRouter models instead of Anthropic models (they're not cheap). At the
  moment I'm really enjoying [[https://huggingface.co/zai-org/GLM-4.6][GLM 4.6]] from [[https://z.ai][Z.ai]] for coding and Gemini 2.5 Flash
  for quick tasks.
- I also added [[https://github.com/stevemolitor/claude-code.el][claude-code.el]] by Steve Molitor to my [[https://github.com/mdallastella/.emacs.d][Emacs configuration]]. It's
  nice to have an AI assistant inside the editor. I don't do any vibe-coding
  sessions, but it's helpful for tedious tasks. I tried ECA and Aider before,
  but I wasn't completely satisfied with the integrations and the
  configuration. I will keep a look at ECA, anyway, in case Claude Code will
  stop working with ccr.

*** Go
After [[/posts/week_37/][giving up]] with Rust, I took a look at Zig, but I don't think the ecosystem
is mature yet for production and, like Rust, it's too low level for my
needs.

Instead, I started to study Go. I'm still not a fan of imperative programming,
but I find Go better than Python TBH. First of all, Go can be compiled to a
single portable binary: this is useful with docker images, where with Python I
need to produce huge images with all the project dependencies.
Go does not need external libraries or funny tricks for async or concurrency,
and does not have Python GIL limitations. Also, thanks to Clojure core.async,
I'm already familiar with the CSP model.
