#+TITLE: MDS

My name is Marco and I’m a code alchemist, and a
thinker. Currently, I’m the CTO and co-founder of small company, 7bridges
s.r.l..

Alchemist, ‘cause I think computer science is about transmutation: instead of
noble metals, we try to obtain noble data. This involves science, philosophy,
magic and a bit of faith. It’s a complex matter.

Thinker, ‘cause I choose to follow the statement “The world is full of
fascinating problems waiting to be solved.”. I choose to solve those problems
with my intellect and some wizardry called programming languages.

I cast my spells with Clojure, but it’s just a means to an end: my final purpose
is leaving the world a little more beautiful, and Lisp dialects are the best
wands around.

I don’t have time to waste in hatred.
