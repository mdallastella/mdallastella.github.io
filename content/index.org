My name is Marco, and I’m a code alchemist and a thinker. Currently, I’m the CTO and co-founder of 7bridges s.r.l.

Alchemist, because I see computer science as the art of transmutation - not of metals, but of raw data into noble insights. This pursuit blends science, philosophy, magic, and a bit of faith. It’s a complex matter.

Thinker, because I believe the "world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved". I choose to tackle them with my intellect and some wizardry called programming languages.

I cast my spells with Clojure, a language built for clarity and power - ideal for an alchemist's work. But it’s just a means to an end: my purpose is to leave the world a little more beautiful, and Lisp dialects are the best wands I’ve found.

I focus my energy on creation, leaving no time for hatred.
