My name is Marco, and I’m a code alchemist and a thinker. Currently, I’m the CTO
and co-founder of [7bridges](https://7bridges.eu) and admin of the Mastodon instance [functional.cafe](https://functional.cafe).

Alchemist, because I see computer science as the art of transmutation - not of
metals, but of raw data into noble insights. This pursuit blends science,
philosophy, magic, and a bit of faith. It’s a complex matter.

Thinker, because I believe the "world is full of fascinating problems waiting to
be solved". I choose to tackle them with my intellect and some wizardry called
programming languages.

I cast my spells with [Clojure](https://clojure.org), a language built for clarity and power - ideal
for an alchemist's work. But it’s just a means to an end: my purpose is to leave
the world a little more beautiful, and Lisp dialects are the best wands I’ve
found.
