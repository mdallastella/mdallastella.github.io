title: About me
---

My name is Marco and I’m a code alchemist, thinker, and musician.

Alchemist, ‘cause I think computer science is about transmutation: instead of
noble metals, we try to obtain noble data. This involves science, philosphy,
magic and a bit of faith. It’s a complex matter.

Thinker, ‘cause I choose to follow the statement “The world is full of
fascinating problems waiting to be solved.”. I choose to solve those problems
with my intellect and some wizardry called programming languages.

I cast my spells with [Clojure](https://clojure.org), a language built for clarity and power - ideal
for an alchemist's work. But it’s just a means to an end: my purpose is to leave
the world a little more beautiful, and Lisp dialects are the best wands I’ve
found.

I choose to follow no religion, no politic principles. I don’t judge others by
their age, race, sex, or beliefs but by how they act.

Someone wiser than me once said that “Truth is a pathless land” and I agree.
