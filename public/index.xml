It is perhaps a bit strange to start a blog by summing things up… but it is
still a starting point.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;#39;m 44 years old and I&amp;#39;ve been a software developer for 25 years. 10 years ago,
I started a consulting and development company. I thought it was the best way to
do what I loved: solving other people&amp;#39;s problems with creativity, intelligence
and elegance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
It turns out it&amp;#39;s not what I expected: money always gets in the way, so you end
up doing stuff you don&amp;#39;t like or picking projects you don&amp;#39;t care much about. I
think it&amp;#39;s part of the consulting way: being able to work on what you love is
quite a luxury these days.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://marco.dallastella.name/about-me/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marco.dallastella.name/about-me/</guid><description>&lt;p>
My name is Marco and I’m a code alchemist, thinker, and musician.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Alchemist, ‘cause I think computer science is about transmutation: instead of
noble metals, we try to obtain noble data. This involves science, philosphy,
magic and a bit of faith. It’s a complex matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
Thinker, ‘cause I choose to follow the statement “The world is full of
fascinating problems waiting to be solved.”. I choose to solve those problems
with my intellect and some wizardry called programming languages.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
